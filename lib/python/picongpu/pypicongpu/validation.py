    Check that the Huygens surface positions of an incident-field laser are well-formed.

    The Huygens surface is given as one ``[min, max]`` pair of cell indices per axis
    (x, y, z). A positive value counts cells in from the low/left edge. A negative
    value on the *max* side is interpreted as distance from the high/right edge, i.e.
    as the absolute coordinate ``cell_cnt + max``; a positive value on the *max* side
    is the absolute coordinate and hence the user is responsible for the grid-size
    arithmetic.

    With ``cell_cnt`` (the global number of cells per axis) given, this also checks
    that both surfaces lie inside the global domain and that the bounded volume is
    non-degenerate, i.e. spans at least 2 cells (mirroring the C++ ``checkPositioning``
    in ``Solver.hpp``). For moving-window simulations the YMax side is exempt from the
    inside-the-domain requirement, matching the C++ ``skipMaxCheck``.

    Without ``cell_cnt``, only the structural checks are performed.
